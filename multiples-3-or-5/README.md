## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/multiples-of-3-or-5)

I solve the Katas step-by-step, you can have a look at the commits.

The final code is optimized for readability in a professional setting, not for "cleverness".
I wrote a [Post about Cleverness](https://dev.to/miku86/diary---20180830-4f5e).

### Instructions:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

```
multiplesOf3Or5(10) => 23 // 3, 5, 6, 9 = 23
multiplesOf3Or5(20) => 78 // 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18 = 78
```
