## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/beginner-series-number-3-sum-of-numbers)

I solve the Katas step-by-step, you can have a look at the commits.

The final code is optimized for readability in a professional setting, not for "cleverness".
I wrote a [Post about Cleverness](https://dev.to/miku86/diary---20180830-4f5e).

### Instructions:

Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the numbers between including them too and return it.

If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

a and b are not ordered!

```
getSum(1, 0) == 1   // 1 + 0 = 1
getSum(0, 1) == 1   // 0 + 1 = 1
getSum(1, 1) == 1   // 1 Since both are same
getSum(-1, 2) == 2  // -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2
```
