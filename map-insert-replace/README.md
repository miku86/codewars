## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/572fdeb4380bb703fc00002c)

I solve the Katas step-by-step, you can have a look at the commits.

The final code is optimized for readability in a professional setting, not for "cleverness".
I wrote a [Post about Cleverness](https://dev.to/miku86/diary---20180830-4f5e).

### Instructions:

Coding in function `isolateIt`. function accept 1 parameters `arr`, it's a string array. Your task is to put a character "|" into the middle of each element.

If the string length is an even number, use the insert method.
If the string length is an odd number, use the replacement method.

The original array should not be changed, you need to return a new array.

```
isolateIt(["abcd","efgh"]) should return ["ab|cd","ef|gh"]
isolateIt(["abcde","fghij"]) should return ["ab|de","fg|ij"]
isolateIt(["1234","56789"]) should return ["12|34","56|89"]
```
