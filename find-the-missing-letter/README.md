## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-missing-letter)

I solve the Katas step-by-step, you can have a look at the commits.

The final code is optimized for readability in a professional setting, not for "cleverness".
I wrote a [Post about Cleverness](https://dev.to/miku86/diary---20180830-4f5e).

### Instructions:

Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter in the array.

You will always get an valid array.
It will be always exactly one letter be missing.
The length of the array will always be at least 2.
The array will always contain letters in only one case.
Use the English alphabet with 26 letters.

```
['a','b','c','d','f'] // 'e'
['O','Q','R','S'] // 'P'
```
