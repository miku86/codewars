## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/multiples-of-3-or-5)

I solve the Katas step-by-step, you can have a look at the commits.

The final code is optimized for readability in a professional setting, not for "cleverness".
I wrote a [Post about Cleverness](https://dev.to/miku86/diary---20180830-4f5e).

### Instructions:

A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given `n`, take the sum of the digits of n.
If that value has two digits, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced.

This is only applicable to the natural numbers.

```
digital_root(16)
=> 1 + 6
=> 7

digital_root(493193)
=> 4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3
=> 29 ...
=> 2 + 9
=> 11 ...
=> 1 + 1
=> 2
```
