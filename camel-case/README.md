## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/convert-string-to-camel-case)

I solve the Katas step-by-step, you can have a look at the commits.

The final code is optimized for readability in a professional setting, not for "cleverness".
I wrote a [Post about Cleverness](https://dev.to/miku86/diary---20180830-4f5e).

### Instructions:

Complete the function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized.

```
toCamelCase("the-stealth-warrior") // returns "theStealthWarrior"
toCamelCase("The_Stealth_Warrior") // returns "TheStealthWarrior"
```
