## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-parity-outlier)

I solve the Katas step-by-step, you can have a look at the commits.

The final code is optimized for readability in a professional setting, not for "cleverness".
I wrote a [Post about Cleverness](https://dev.to/miku86/diary---20180830-4f5e).

### Instructions:

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers.

The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N.
Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

```
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160 (the only even number)
```
