## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/isograms)

I solve the Katas step-by-step, you can have a look at the commits.

The final code is optimized for readability in a professional setting, not for "cleverness".
I wrote a [Post about Cleverness](https://dev.to/miku86/diary---20180830-4f5e).

### Instructions:

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive.

Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram.

Assume the empty string is an isogram.
Ignore letter case.

```
isIsogram("Dermatoglyphics") // true
isIsogram("aba") // false
isIsogram("moOse") // false // -- ignore letter case
```
