## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-two-lowest-positive-integers)

I solve the Katas step-by-step, you can have a look at the commits.

The final code is optimized for readability in a professional setting, not for "cleverness".
I wrote a [Post about Cleverness](https://dev.to/miku86/diary---20180830-4f5e).

### Instructions:

Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 integers.

No floats or empty arrays will be passed.

Do not modify the original array.

```
[19, 5, 42, 2, 77] // 7, because 2 + 5
[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453] // 3453455, because 10 + 3453445
```
