## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/multiples-of-3-or-5)

I solve the Katas step-by-step, you can have a look at the commits.

The final code is optimized for readability in a professional setting, not for "cleverness".
I wrote a [Post about Cleverness](https://dev.to/miku86/diary---20180830-4f5e).

### Instructions:

Given an array of numbers, sort them in such a manner that all the odd numbers in the array are sorted in ascending order and the even numbers are sorted in descending order after the last odd number.

If the array contains decimals, round them down while checking for odd/even.

The output must have the original numbers!

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] => [1,3,5,7,9,8,6,4,2]
```
