/*
* The function finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter.
* An integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.
* If the parameter is itself not a perfect square, than -1 should be returned.
* Also check for the input as a number.

* @Input: no specific type
* @Output: number
