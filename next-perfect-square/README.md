## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-next-perfect-square)

Instructions:

You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the `findNextSquare` method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter.

Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that `sqrt(n)` is also an integer.

If the parameter is itself not a perfect square, than `-1` should be returned. You may assume the parameter is positive.

```
Examples:

findNextSquare(121) --> returns 144
findNextSquare(625) --> returns 676
findNextSquare(114) --> returns -1 since 114 is not a perfect
```
