## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-pig-latin)

I solve the Katas step-by-step, you can have a look at the commits.

The final code is optimized for readability in a professional setting, not for "cleverness".
I wrote a [Post about Cleverness](https://dev.to/miku86/diary---20180830-4f5e).

### Instructions:

Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word.
Leave punctuation marks untouched.

```
pigIt('Pig latin is cool'); // igPay atinlay siay oolcay
pigIt('Hello world !'); // elloHay orldWay !
```
