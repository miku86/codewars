## About this Kata

[Source](https://www.codewars.com/kata/two-to-one)

I solve the Katas step-by-step, you can have a look at the commits.

The final code is optimized for readability in a professional setting, not for "cleverness".
I wrote a [Post about Cleverness](https://dev.to/miku86/diary---20180830-4f5e).

### Instructions:

Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from a to z.

Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters, each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

````
a = "xyaabbbccccdefww", b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq" // longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"
a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" // longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" ```
````
